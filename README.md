Perma Time
=============

Makes it possible to permanently have day/night without changing the game time.  
Type `/ptime` to either enable permanent daylight, permanent night or disable permanent time.

You can use the setting 'ptime.default_newplayers' to set the behavior for new joining players 
(default: ptime disabled).
